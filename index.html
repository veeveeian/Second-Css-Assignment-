                <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaung's life</h3><br>

                    Charles Stakman, he returns to school <br> study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest
                    <br>
                    -resistent plants.

                    other

                <li><b>1942 -</b>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><b>1944 -</b>Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies
                    to

                    to head a new plant pathology <br> program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
                    <br>
                    strains
                    of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for <br> each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li><b>1945 -</b>Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling <br> wheat yields</li>
                <li><b>1953 -</b>rosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high <br>
                    -yeidling American breed, creating a
                    strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br> provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><b>1962 -</b>Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br> Indian subcontinent in

                <li><b>2005 -</b>states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050. <br> " Argues that genetically
                    modified
                    crops <br> are the only way we can <br> meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
                    crops <br> are
                    not
                    inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically <br> modifying plants and animals for a long

                    Long
                    before we called <br> it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
